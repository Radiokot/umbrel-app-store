description: >-
  Start a secure tunnel to access your Umbrel apps from the Internet using Cloudflare network. 
  With Tunnel, you do not send traffic to an external IP â€” instead, 
  this app containing a lightweight tunneluing daemon (cloudflared) creates outbound-only 
  connections to Cloudflare's global network.


  To use this app, you must have a set up Cloudflare account with added domains.
  Under the Cloudflare tunnel Public hostnames configuration, 
  use the Umbrel domain or 'host.docker.internal' in the URL field.
